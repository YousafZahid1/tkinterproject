# Tkinter Sign-Up and Login System

This project is a simple **Sign-Up and Login System** created using Python and Tkinter. It demonstrates the use of a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage user credentials and basic file handling to store and retrieve data. The application features a `Sign-Up` page where users can create accounts and a `Login` page to validate those accounts.

## Features

### Sign-Up Page
- Users can enter their name, username, and password to create an account.
- A **Generate Password** button allows users to generate a random 12-character password.
- User credentials (username and password) are stored securely in a text file (`info.txt`).

### Login Page
- Users can enter their username and password to log in.
- The system validates credentials against the stored data in `info.txt`.
- Provides feedback in the console about login success or failure.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (built-in module in Python)
- A text editor or IDE to run the script.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
2. Run the script using Python:
